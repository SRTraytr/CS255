Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The goal of the DriverPass project was to create a system where customers could purchase driving instruction packages, access educational material, take practice tests and schedule in-person lessons with driving instructors. 

What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did particularly well on the system requirements document. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to revise my use case diagram to capture aspects of the system I did not consider fully at the time I created it. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the users’ needs by carefully reading the interview transcript and making notes of the desired features. I also considered best practices such as accessibility and security. If the users need aren't considered while designing, the developer will have wasted time creating a system that doesn’t work for the client. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I am a visual thinker, so I often start designs by sketching out a flow chart to get my ideas on paper. I also like to make sure I have the requirements in front of me so I can check them off as they are addressed.
